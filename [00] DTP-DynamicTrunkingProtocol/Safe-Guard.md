# Safeguards Against Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) Attack

Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in Cisco switches to disrupt network operations or gain unauthorized access. Here are some safeguards to protect against DTP attacks:

## Disable DTP

  The most effective safeguard against DTP attacks is `to disable DTP entirely on switch interfaces`. By manually configuring interfaces as access ports (non-trunking), you prevent them from participating in DTP negotiations and eliminate the risk of DTP-based attacks.

- **To disable DTP in a switch port, follow these commands**:
      
  1. **Start switch configuration terminal interface**:

      ```
      configure terminal
      ```
  2. **Specify the interface**:

      ```
      interface <INTERFACE_ID>
      ```
  3. **Disable DTP protocol on that interface by enabling access mode on it**:

      ```
      switchport mode access
      ```

## Enable Port Security
  
  Implement port security features to limit the number of MAC addresses allowed on a port and prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network. This helps mitigate the risk of attackers gaining access through compromised or rogue devices.
  
  1. **Start switch configuration terminal interface**:
      ```
      configue terminal
      ```
  2. **Specify the interface you want to apply the setting on it**:

      ```
      interface <INTERFACE_ID>
      ```
  3. **Enable Port-Security**:

      ```
      switchport port-security
      ```
  4. **Specify the maximum number of Port MAC Addresses allowed**:

      ```
      switchport port-security maximum <MAX_MACC_COUNT>
      ```
## VLAN Access Control
Use VLAN access control lists (VACLs) or VLAN-based access control to restrict traffic between VLANs and prevent unauthorized VLAN hopping. By controlling the flow of traffic at the VLAN level, you can minimize the impact of DTP attacks and other network threats.

## Continuous Monitoring
  Regularly monitor switch interfaces, VLAN configurations, and network traffic for any signs of suspicious activity or unauthorized changes. Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) or security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to detect and respond to DTP attacks in real-time.

## Security Awareness and Training
  Educate network administrators and users about the risks of DTP attacks and the importance of following security best practices. By raising awareness and providing training on how to identify and mitigate security threats, you empower individuals to contribute to the overall security posture of the network.

## Conclusion
  ***Protecting against DTP attacks requires a combination of proactive security measures, including disabling DTP, implementing port security, controlling VLAN access, continuous monitoring, and security awareness training. By taking these safeguards into account, organizations can strengthen their defenses and mitigate the risk of DTP-based vulnerabilities.***
